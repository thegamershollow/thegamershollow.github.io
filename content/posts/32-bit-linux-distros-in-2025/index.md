## An overview of the 32bit CPU architecture

The 32bit CPU architecture has been deprecated by Intel as of January 5th, 2023. But some people still own laptops and even desktops with 32bit CPUs in them. but with age comes the question, what OS should I use on these old laptops? Windows, Linux or another Unix based OS? I am going to go over installing Linux on 32bit computers because most, if not all 32bit computers are old, and Linux is one of the best OSs to install on an old laptop to keep it fresh and running smooth.

## How to resurrect a 32bit computer with Linux

Linux is one of the best OSs to put on old laptops due to it being lightweight and open source.
